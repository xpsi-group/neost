Contributing
------------

We outline below the workflow we use for developing NEoST.

Contact
~~~~~~~

You are welcome to contact members of the NEoST directly if you have
any questions about the software or its use (for the current active list see
the :ref:`acknowledgements` page).
To get in touch with us regarding bugs and issues the easiest way is via the
github `Issues <https://github.com/xpsi-group/neost/issues/>`_ page.

Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To contribute to this project you can do so whilst being recognised as either
a community member or a team member. If you contribute to feature development
publicly on GitHub, you may well be invited to be recognised as a team member in
the :ref:`acknowledgements`.

Past developers are recognised as team members unless they no longer wish to be.
Aside from acknowledging your contribution, this is useful for feature
maintenance and as a contact point for questions, if permission is granted.
Past team members will be acknowledged as such.

If you wish to base a major research project on the
development and/or application of NEoST we invite you to discuss you (and your
group where applicable) joining the NEoST team in order to collaborate. If you
find this idea interesting then please contact Anna Watts (contact details
are on the :ref:`acknowledgements` page).

.. _workflow:

GitHub repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEoST is an open-source project and we aspire that all NEoST versions required
for reproducibility of publications have release tags on GitHub.

End-users and community contributors can interact with the project freely on
GitHub. If you want to contribute a feature, you are welcome to communicate with us
either on GitHub via issues and pull-requests, or by contacting a team member directly.
