<p>The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate how one can fix the prior-likelihood to a constant value and use multinest to sample the prior space log-uniformly with asymmetric dark matter(ADM) present. Within this script, one can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PosteriorAnalysis.py</span></code>script to generate the prior axuiliary data and the prior 95% confidence intervals.</p>
<p>The following block of code will properly import NEoST and its prerequisites, furthermore it also defines a name for the inference run, this name is what will be prefixed to all of NEoST’s output files.</p>
<p>The machinary used within this script and the explanation of them is identical to those found in the Piecewise Polytropic, Speed of Sound, and Tabulated Examples.</p>

<p>Below, we define the piecewise polytripic equation of state model, import the J0740 likelihood function, set the ADM particle type to be a boson, and set whether we want to calculate ADM halos as well as the two-fluid tidal deformability. Note, both dm_halo and two_fluid_tidal are set to be False by default, so a user doesn’t need to define them before-hand if they don’t want to consider them in their inference. We wanted to highlight these parameters so that one knew where to define them in the
event that either parameter were to be considered.</p>

<p>Below, we define the piecewise polytripic equation of state model, import the J0740 likelihood function, and set the variable paramaeters with their respective prior space intervals depending on the their <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adm_type</span></code> string parameter value.

<p><strong>When finished with testing your likelihood and prior you can proceed to the actual inference process. This is done in the code block below. Warning: depending on the performance of your platform, this might be a very slow process. To make it slightly faster, we have decreased the number of live points and set a maximum number of iterations for this example. For a proper analysis, we would remove the max_iter argument and set, for example, n_live_points=30000.</strong></p>
