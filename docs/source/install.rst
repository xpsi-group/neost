Installation
============

NEoST is a Python software package that performs neutron star equation
of state inference process. It is an open source package that is available
on `GitHub`_ and can be cloned as:

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/xpsi-group/neost.git

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone https://github.com/xpsi-group/neost.git </path/to/neost>

On this page we will describe how to install NEoST and its prerequisites.

Prerequisite Python Packages
----------------------------

NEoST was developed in Python 3, as such we recommend creating a conda virtual
environment with anaconda3 or miniconda3 according to the instructions below. This will
ensure installing NEoST won't break any existing software packages.

.. _basic_env:

Assuming a conda base environment has been installed and activated (see conda
installation instructions), a new virtual Python environment can then be created
by navigating to the NEoST base directory and entering the following command into the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda env create -f environment.yml

This command will create a new conda environment called neost and install all dependencies.
If you don't want to use conda, you can install the dependencies listed in environment.yml
in your preferred way.

Next, in order to be able to install NEoST itself in the new environment, enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda activate neost

This command changes the active virtual environment from the default base
environment to the new neost environment and needs to be entered any time
NEoST is used.

Installing NEoST
----------------

With the prerequisites out of the way, NEoST can now be installed. First (if
you haven't done so already) navigate to the directory where NEoST's source
code was extracted and activate the conda environment. Then install NEoST with

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install .

Alternatively, NEoST can be installed without cythonizing the TOV solvers, however this results
in much slower performance. To do this, enter the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

	python setup.py install --nocython


.. Alternative instructions for prerequisites
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. There are alternative ways to install GSL, MultiNest and PyMultiNest.
.. To manually install GSL enter the following
.. into a terminal:

.. code-block .. :: bash

	wget -v http://mirror.koddos.net/gnu/gsl/gsl-latest.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz
	cd gsl-latest
	./configure CC=gcc --prefix=$HOME/gsl
	make
	make check
	make install
	make installcheck
	make clean

.. With this done GSL will have to be added to your path, this is done with the
.. following command:

.. code-block .. :: bash

	export PATH=$HOME/gsl/bin:$PATH

.. This command must be given any time GSL is used, therefore it is recommended
.. to add this command to your ``~.bashrc`` file.

.. In order to manually install MultiNest and PyMultinest, first install the
.. prerequisites. These are mpi4py and compilers for c and fortran and can be
.. installed with the following commands:

.. code-block .. :: bash

	conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py
	sudo apt-get install cmake libblad-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev

.. When these have finished installing, clone the MultiNest repository, navigate
.. to the cloned repository and install MultiNest using the following commands:

.. code-block .. :: bash

	git clone https://github.com/farhanferoz/MultiNest.git <path/to/clone>/multinest
	cd <path/to/clone>/multinest/MultiNest_v3.12_CMake/multinest/
	mkdir build
	cd build
	CC=gcc FC=mpif90 CXX=g++ cmake -DCMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native -funroll-loops" -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-O3 -march=native -funroll-loops" ..
	make
	ls ../lib/

.. This is the sequence of commands to install MultiNest, the final step now is
.. to install the Python interface to MultiNest, PyMultiNest. For this, run the following commands:

.. code-block .. :: bash

	git clone https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest.git <path/to/clone>/pymultinest
	cd <path/to/clone>/pymultinest
	python setup.py install [--user]

.. This will install the package in your NEoST environment if this is the active
.. environment. If this is the case, the ``--user`` flag needs
.. to be omitted. Next, PyMultiNest needs to be interfaced with multinest itself,
.. this is done by using the following single-line command

.. code-block .. :: bash

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/my/directory/MultiNest/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

.. This command too needs to be given anytime you wish to use PyMultiNest and MultiNest together,
.. so it is again recommended to add it to your ``~.bashrc`` file.

.. Documentation
.. -------------

.. If you wish to compile the documentation you require
.. `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master>`_ and extensions. To install
.. these, run the following commands:

.. code-block .. :: bash

    conda install sphinx
    conda install -c conda-forge nbsphinx
    conda install decorator
    conda install sphinxcontrib-websupport
    conda install sphinx_rtd_theme
    conda install pandoc

.. Note, one can also perform these commands using ``pip`` instead of ``conda``. Now the documentation can be compiled using:

.. code-block .. :: bash

    cd NEoST-main/docs; [make clean;] make html

.. To rebuild the documentation after a change to source code docstrings:

.. code-block .. :: bash

    [CC=<path/to/compiler/executable>] python setup.py install [--user]; cd
    docs; make clean; make html; cd ..

.. The ``.html`` files can then found in ``NEoST-main/docs/build/html``, along with the
.. notebooks for the tutorials in this documentation. The ``.html`` files can
.. naturally be opened in a browser, handily via a Jupyter session (this is
.. particularly useful if the edits are to tutorial notebooks).

.. Note that if you require links to the source code in the HTML files, you need
.. to ensure Sphinx imports the ``NEoST`` package from the source directory
.. instead of from the ``~/.local/lib`` directory of the user. To enforce this,
.. insert the path to the source directory into ``sys.path`` in the ``conf.py``
.. script. Then make sure the extension modules are inside the source directory
.. -- i.e., the package is built in-place (see above).

.. note ..::

   To build the documentation, all modules need to be imported, and the
   dependencies that are not resolved will print warning messages.
