When using NEoST for EOS inference using the chiral EFT + PP/CS extension, please also cite either 
`Raaijmakers et al. (2021) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918L..29R/abstract>`_  or `Greif, Raaijmakers et al. (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.5363G/abstract>`_. 


If you wish to cite published appliations of the NEoST package you can find a list of papers that have used the software via :ref:`publications`.



NEoST also has numerous dependencies that users also benefit from, which should ideally be acknowledged as well.
