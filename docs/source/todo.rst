Future
------

If there is a feature you would like to see that is not currently
implemented in the package please let us know!  We are currently working on the following upgrades:

* Adding the facility to use information from EM counterparts of GW events (as done in `Raaijmakers et al. 2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...918L..29R/abstract>`_).
* Adding the facility to do inference including dark matter components (as done in `Rutherford et al. 2023 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PhRvD.107j3051R/abstract>`_).
* Linking to alternative samplers.
